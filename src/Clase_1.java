                            known. fixed size.

        Ordered array       Quicker search than         Slow insertion and
                            unsorted array.             deletion, fixed size

        Stack               Provides, last-in,          Slow access to other items.
                            first-out access

        Queue               Provides first-in,          Slow access to
                            first-out access.           other items.

        Linked list         Quick insertion,            Slow search.
                            quick deletion.

        Binary tree         Quick search, insertion,    Deletion algorithm
                            deletion (if tree is complex.
                            remains balanced).
